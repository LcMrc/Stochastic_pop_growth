# Stochastic_pop_growth

Matlab implementation of the code described in: "([Solving the stochastic dynamics of population growth](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.15.516663v1))" by Loïc Marrec, Claudia Bank, and Thibault Bertrand.

Archived version: TBA

Our code provides two things:
1) Stochastic simulations of a population growing in a constant environment where a single type of individual exists.
2) Computation of the probability that the population has a given size at a given time.

In order to use the code, please run "run_stochasticGrowth.m" under Matlab.
